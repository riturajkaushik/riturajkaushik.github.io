Wouldn't be it amazing if machines could be able to think like us and learn some stuff like cooking, playing some sports, responding to phone calls all by themselves? Well we are actually heading in that direction currently and future is probably not that far. This particular field of research comes under the umbrella of Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is amazing because using this approach we can actually program some self learning behaviors into machines and let them learn anything by trying and gaining experience. In this article to give an idea about how we can program such "self learning machines", I am going to explain the basic steps of a **self learning tic-tac-toe game agent** that learns how to play the game by playing thousands of games with itself. We are going to code everything in Python programming language without using any special library.

So, the approach that I am going to explain is based on something called **MENACE** (Matchbox Educable Naughts and Crosses Engine) proposed by Donald Michie in 1961. The basic idea is this: MENACE consisted of a matchbox for each possible game position, each matchbox containing a number of colored beads, a different color for each possible move from that position. By drawing a bead at random from the matchbox corresponding to the current game position, one could determine MENACE’s move. When a game was over, beads were added to or removed from the boxes used during play to reinforce or punish MENACE’s decisions [1]. Did you get it? Don't worry. Let's see this idea in detail:

So for each configuration of the tic-tac-toe game, we have to have a match box. We will through away the match sticks and put some beads of 9 different colors. Each colour should have more or less equal number of beads.
