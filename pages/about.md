## Brief Intro

I am currently a doctoral researcher (3rd year PhD candidate) at [INRIA - Nancy, France](https://team.inria.fr/larsen/){:target:"_black"}. My broad area of interests comes under the umbrella of machine learning, reinforcement learning and machine learning for robotics (i.e *robot learning*). During my PhD I have been working on algorithms that enable robots (or any dynamical system, agent) to learn controllers/policies with as fewer interactions as possible with the robot/system. Data efficiency in robot policy search has been my primary focus and I am trying to develop and improve *data-efficient model-based policy search* approaches for *non-sparse* as well as *sparse reward* set up of reinforcement learning.
